# 📸 ImageDimensionChecker

**ImageDimensionChecker** is a Python package designed to streamline the process of analyzing image datasets. It provides functions to check if images in a directory have the same dimensions, count the number of unique file extensions, and identify unique image dimensions.

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Check Image Dimensions**: Determine if all images in a directory have the same dimensions.

🔢 **Count Unique File Extensions**: Count the occurrences of each unique file extension in a directory.

📏 **Identify Unique Image Dimensions**: Find the unique dimensions (width and height) of images in a directory.

## 📦 Installation

You can install ImageDimensionChecker via pip:

```bash
pip install ImageDimensionChecker
```

## 🛠️ Usage

Here's a quick guide on how to use ImageDimensionChecker:

### 🔍 Check Image Dimensions

```python
from ImageDimensionChecker import CheckImageDimension

# Specify the path to the directory containing images
path = "/path/to/images"

CheckImageDimension(path)
```

### 🔢 Count Unique File Extensions

```python
from ImageDimensionChecker import unique_extension

# Specify the path to the directory containing images
path = "/path/to/images"

unique_extension(path)
```

### 📏 Identify Unique Image Dimensions

```python
from ImageDimensionChecker import unique_dimension

path = "/path/to/images"

unique_dimension(path)
```
